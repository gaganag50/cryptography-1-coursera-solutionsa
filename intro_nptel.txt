1 one wayness--> x->f(x) is easy but f(x)->x is hard
It is easy to compute but hard to invert;

2 collision resistance
given f(x), output two values x not equal to y, such that f(x)=f(y)
 Magic function ,f satisfies 1 and 2

 an even number x represents HEAD
 an odd number x represents Tail

 Alice and Bob shall be using the function f to communicate the parity of x.


Alice picks up randomly a large integer, x and compute f(x)
Bob tells Alice his guess of whether x is odd or even
Alice then sends x to Bob
Bob verifies by computing f(x)

Can anyone cheat?
1--> by listening to the value of f(x), Bob has to guess about the parity of x
	as this is hard, Bob's probablity to guess x is 1/2(either even or odd)
2--> After computinf f(x), Alice might change x such the f(x) = f(y), where x and y have different parity but this is again hard.

Hence no one can cheat

3 main goals of crytography:
1--> cofidentiality(hiding the information from unauthorized access)
2--> integrity(preventing information from unauthorized modification)
3--> availability(should be easily available to authorized users)

crytograhpy and crytoanalysis->crytology

Threat to confidentiality
Snooping-> Refers to unauthorized access or interception of informaiton. Encryption is used to make information non-intelligble to the snooper.
Traffic Analysis-> Even an encrypted message can be analyzed to obtain some information, like say the identily of the sender and the recipient, the nature of the information(like text or image file).

Threat to integrity
Modification-> an attacker can modify the transmitted information, without needing to know the actual content.It could delay or change the content to foil the objective of a transaction.
Masquerading: An attacker can modify the communication data to pretent(spoof) as a legal sender or receiver to obtain the information to which it does not have access.
